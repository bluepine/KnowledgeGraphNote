# KnowledgeGraphNote

See [unit test file](./test/runtests.jl) for usage.

This package is structured as a Julia package but I probably won't have time to maintain it as a [publicly registered](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl) package. You can checkout this repo locally and then use the activate command of Julia package manager ([https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/index.html](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/index.html)) to activate this package locally.

Like this:
```
@v1.4) pkg> activate [path to your local KnowledgeGraphNote non-bare repo]
```
